# FullyAssociativeCacheSimulator
A Python-based simulator for fully associative caches that mimics real-world cache behavior. It calculates tag bits, byte offsets, and indexes, evaluates cache hits/misses, and uses the LRU replacement policy for efficient memory management. The simulator supports experimentation with varying cache sizes, block sizes, and associativity.
